/documentation
this folder will house various fucked up badly organized notes, including this
file.

/lib
houses all reusable utility functions
  > menuHelper.js
    intended to interface with /resources/strings.json for the most part. should
    keep the classes cleaner
  > renshuuHelper.js
    will house code that does test stuff, like randomization, shuffling(same
    fucking thing as randomization...), and test organizing(fuck, no different).
    Intended to interface with /resources/? for the most part, keep renshuu
    classes cleaner.

/menus
houses all navigation items that make sense to have its own class. I am still
on the fence regarding organization of these files. my biggest delimiter at the
moment is keeping the navigate function clean. the second it becomes dirty, make
a new menu item

/resources
this folder will house... resources, like dictionaries, things and stuff
  > string.json
    this file is basically stealing Google Android's way of defining strings in apps.
    If we keep names and descriptions here, it should make it easier to manipulate,
    especially since we intend to use more than one language for the same names/
    descriptions. DESIGN THIS GOOD OR ELSE
