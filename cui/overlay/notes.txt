IDEAS:
  - how about CTRL + j for jap speech input, CTRL + e for english? how do we tell
    it what it should output??
  - CTRL + s to save on settings pages
  - CTRL + i to go to the Aibo Text Input Mode page

TODO:
  - testing
    - add emojis where possible. like ðŸ“• = hon, ðŸ‘œ = kaban, so on

  - implement settings page and update corresponding icon in overlay
  - play/record functionality with updated overlay icons(too much for a PoC)

    - ./game0.txt
  - indicators
    - loading bars, etc. create them as a class, imported and simply updated to
      show progress. EX.
        const bar = new Indicator('loadingBar')
        bar.progress = 0
        bar.progress = 50
        bar.progress = 100 // done?
