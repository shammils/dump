/*
in progress genki material goes here
- extract any functionality needed from tester into utils if it isnt already up to snuff
- courses will support more than just question/answer, and rather build a new simple
  thing instead of changing that old ass code
- we can integrate with kawaru to turn our romanji into kana
- steal the intToKana and dateToKana fns from that one project for this
*/
